The website was created using the React JS framework. It uses the API provided by the **[TMDB Platform](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)** to query movie information.

To make requests to the API, the Fetch API was used.
The site uses the React Router Dom library to enable navigation between pages and the React Icons library to provide unique icons for site styling.

Vite was used to create the project structure, so it was possible to use environment variables to store important information for API requests.

Note that to make the website functional you must insert a valid API Key in the ".env" file in the variable "VITE_API_KEY"!. If you have any questions, consult the **[TMDB API Documentation](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)**.
